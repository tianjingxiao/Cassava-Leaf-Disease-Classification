# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification

This my project when I had course at UCSD

The report is named as "Cassava Leaf Disease Classification"

● Remove samples from the majority class (under-sampling) or adding more examples from the minority class (over- sampling) to solve the imbalanced dataset, prevent the model trained to have a high tendency to be biased.

● Implement and train different models like ResNet18&50, MobileNetV2, and MnasNet without dropout layer on PyTorch to classify cassava images into 5 disease categories using data set from Kaggle.
